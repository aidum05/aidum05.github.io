    Design Guidelines:
    ==========================
    1. User Experience (UX):
       - Minimalist, intuitive UI designed for common laboratory workflows.
       - Mobile and desktop compatibility with consistent styling (Tailwind CSS).
       - Flexible workflows with basic inputs.

    2. Maintainability:
       - Modular design for better readability and reusability (e.g., separate unit handling, form rendering, logic).
       - Test new features before integration.

    3. Free Hosting:
       - All pages work seamlessly on GitHub Pages.

    4. Receipt System:
       - Always visible, displays inputs, intermediate steps, and final results with units.
       - Dynamically cleared between calculations.

    5. Unit Handling:
       - Account for units in all calculators (mass, volume, concentration, etc.).
       - Separate file/module for unit handling (`unit_conversion.js`).

    6. Modular Expandability:
       - Easy addition of calculators without breaking existing functionality.
       - Consistent form layout for all calculators.

    7. Future Features:
       - Integrate APIs or libraries for advanced functionality.
       - User requests for new calculators via a dedicated page.
       - Add support for advanced calculations.
